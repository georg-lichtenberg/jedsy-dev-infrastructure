# Ping Status Fix Deployment Report

## Changes Implemented

The nebula-healthcheck-service has been updated with the following changes to fix the ping status bug:

1. **CIDR Notation Handling**: Modified the `pingTarget` function to strip CIDR notation from IP addresses before attempting to ping

   ```go
   cleanIP := strings.Split(ip, "/")[0]
   ```

2. **Increased Reliability**:

   - Changed ping count from 1 to 3 attempts
   - Extended timeout from 3 to 5 seconds

3. **Improved Logging**: Added more detailed status information in logs

## Deployment

- Committed to branch: `feature/device-identification-system`
- Commit hash: `c29abd0`
- Pushed to repository: `PackageGlider/nebula-healthcheck-service`

## Verification Steps

**Important**: The complete CI/CD pipeline must run before changes can be tested on staging. Wait for GitHub Actions to show successful deployment before proceeding with verification.

To verify the fix on the staging server, perform the following steps:

1. Monitor the status of the test drone (M24-12) via API:

   ```bash
   curl -s "https://ping.uphi.cc/status/enhanced?device_name=M24-12" | jq '.'
   ```

2. Expected outcome:

   - Connection status should change from "offline" to "online"
   - Consecutive failures should reset to 0
   - Last ping ms should be populated with a valid value

3. Compare with manual ping test:
   ```bash
   ping 172.20.0.7
   ```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are encountered, roll back to the previous version:

1. Revert the commit:

   ```bash
   git revert c29abd0
   git push origin feature/device-identification-system
   ```

2. Redeploy the service to staging

## Technical Details

The root cause of the issue was that the ping function was trying to use the full IP address with CIDR notation (e.g., "172.20.0.7/32") directly in the ping command. By extracting just the IP portion, we ensure compatibility with the ping library.

Additionally, increasing the ping count and timeout provides more resilience against temporary network issues, which should reduce false negative results.
